# üëì AR-instruction for the Mitsubishi MELFA Robotic Complex using Microsoft Hololens2 headset (object-locking)

An augmented reality (AR) application is being developed to study the elemental composition and enable further technical maintenance of the Mitsubishi MELFA robotic system. Implementing digital prompts using AR technology (instructions in augmented reality) allows for the integration of real-world and digital information within the user's field of view, creating the illusion of a unified environment.

## ü§ñ What can this help with?

* An effective way to present information based on modern digital technologies that minimizes the risks of injuries and equipment breakdown during the learning process of new material.

* Augmented reality technologies make it possible to improve the quality of acquired knowledge and practical skills: more effective than "two-dimensional" instructions (documentation, operating instructions) often having a large volume of documents "on paper".

* The possibility of organizing and implementing a learning environment for employees with the aim of increasing work efficiency.

* The development enables the trainee to learn the basic capabilities of a robotic workstation and acquire the skills to perform basic operations on it. Additionally, they will be able to carry out maintenance tasks on the equipment if necessary.
